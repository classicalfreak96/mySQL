# mySQL

This was a semester long class project that was broken down into several segments. I worked with one other partner. 

During this class, we studied, wrote, and implemented the code behind a working SQL database. Each homework covered a different aspect of implementation for an SQL database, which all come together to form a working, simplified database. 

- HW1: Constructing basic building blocks of tables: Tuples. Implemented Catalog that keeps track of what tables are currently in database and provides a way to access them. Implemented HeapFiles which are the physical representation of the data in our database.
- HW2: Implemented relational operations. Also implemented parser to help translate SQL queries into relational operations, effectively allowing users to query the data stored on the "server".
- HW3: Implemented B+ trees for faster catalog searching, integrated with rest of DBMS
- HW4: Implemented strict two phase locking that can be used with transactions, so that there are no data conflicts.
