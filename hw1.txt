While you technically pass the tests I have to take issue with the way you handle creating new heap pages.

It is not appropriate to use an exception as the standard path through a method. Exceptions should be for when things go 
wrong, and adding a tuple is not unexpected behavior. Instead of adding a tuple to a full heap page and letting it fail,
you can simply ask the heap page if it is full before attempting to add the tuple. I really don't want to see a giant
list of error messages just for adding one tuple to the file. (-3)
